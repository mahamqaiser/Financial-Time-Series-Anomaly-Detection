#  Financial Time-Series Anomaly Detection

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in financial time-series data using machine learning techniques. It helps identify irregular patterns that may represent fraud, structural changes, or rare market behavior in stock or asset price data.

##  Project Goals
- Analyze historical financial time series data (e.g., stock prices).
- Detect abnormal behaviors using automated algorithms.
- Visualize the results with clear plots marking anomalies.

##  Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Financial Time-Series Anomaly Detection.ipynb` | Main Jupyter Notebook for loading data, preprocessing, model training, and anomaly visualization. |

##  Features

- ✅ Data loading and cleaning
- ✅ Time-series visualization
- ✅ Anomaly detection using machine learning (e.g., Isolation Forest)
- ✅ Plotting detected anomalies on charts
- ✅ Easy-to-follow code with comments

##  Techniques Used

- **Python Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`
- **Anomaly Detection Models**:
  - Isolation Forest
  - Rolling statistics (mean, standard deviation)
  - Z-score or thresholding
- **Evaluation**: Visual inspection and labeling on plots

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repository or open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Ensure all required libraries are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
